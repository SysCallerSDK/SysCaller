# SysCaller SDK | Roadmap  
_Last updated: 6/29/25 by Maintainer_

---

## High Priority

- [ ] **Finish Custom Stub Maker**  
  Manually create syscall stubs yourself

---

## Feature Enhancements

- [ ] **Add More Obfuscation/Encryption Techniques**  
  Junk logic, encryption layers, stub layout shuffling, sig disorientation.

---

## Language & Integration

- [ ] **Multi language Bindings**  
  Add support for: Rust, Python, Go, C#, etc.

- [ ] **Language Translations for GUI**  
  Begin internationalizing UI/UX: Russian, Spanish, French, etc.

---

## Learning & Documentation

- [ ] **Add More Usage Examples**  
  Include basic to advanced syscall usage patterns and integration in real tools.

- [ ] **Syscall Knowledgebase**  
  Reference sheet in the repo (`docs/`) listing common NT syscalls, descriptions, return types, etc.

---

## Ideas

- [ ] **Runtime Stub Loading**  
  Enable loading encrypted syscall stubs at runtime rather than compile time.
